git,make,unzip,gcc was already installed.


`sudo apt install ripgrep`

win32yank for wsl.


using wezterm, best for cross platform.

# apt install fd-find

need npm for mason to install pyright

need nvm, node version manager
https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
`
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
`
if we don't get nvm by typing nvm:
`export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm`

`nvm install node # "node" is an alias for the latest version`

Then mason works, downloading pyright
